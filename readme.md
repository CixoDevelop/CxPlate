# CxPlate

This is simple project of the plates with numbers. This can be useful for 
purposes such as identifying groups of people being shown around certain 
facilities, which is what it was designed for. The project uses the 
RobotoMono font, available in Google Fonts. Ready-made elements can be cut 
on a CNC laser, milling machine or printed on a 3D printer.
